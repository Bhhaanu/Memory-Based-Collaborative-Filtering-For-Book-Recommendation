# MemoryBasedCollaborativeFiltering-For-BookRecommendationSystem

Memory-Based Collaborative Filtering is a type of recommendation system that uses the similarity between users or items to make predictions. It works by analyzing user-item interactions in a given dataset and identifying patterns of similarity between users or items based on their past interactions. The key idea is that users who have interacted with similar items in the past are likely to have similar preferences, and items that have been rated similarly by users are likely to have similar features.

There are two main approaches to Memory-Based Collaborative Filtering:

User-based Collaborative Filtering: This approach computes the similarity between users based on their past interactions with items. Given a user, it identifies other users who have rated similar items in the past and uses their ratings to make predictions about the user's preferences for new items.

Item-based Collaborative Filtering: This approach computes the similarity between items based on their past ratings by users. Given an item, it identifies other items that have been rated similarly by users and uses these ratings to make predictions about the item's popularity.

Memory-Based Collaborative Filtering is relatively easy to implement and can be applied to a wide range of datasets. However, it suffers from limitations like, the sparsity of user-item interaction data, the scalability of the algorithm to large datasets, and the lack of interpretability of the results.
